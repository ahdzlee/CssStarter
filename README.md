# CSS Starter

This is a very simple HTML page to demo a responsive web site without any 3rd party library or frameworks.

The following are the sections in the site:

- Navigation Bar
- Main Content (divided into two columns)
  - First column to enter username and password.
  - Second column contains an embedded youtube video.
- The Standards of Awesomeness (contains three columns and a Learn More button)
- Some Article
- Footer
